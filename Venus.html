            <h2><p>Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it&rsquo;s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It&rsquo;s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 475 degrees Celsius &ndash; hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it&rsquo;s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it&rsquo;s possible some volcanoes are still active.</p>
            <p>Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.</p>
            <p>Another big difference from Earth – Venus rotates on its axis backward, compared to most of the other planets in the solar system. This means that, on Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, opposite to what we experience on Earth.</p>
