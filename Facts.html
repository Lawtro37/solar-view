                <h1><p>The Sun</p></h1>
                <p>The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun&rsquo;s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). The Sun&rsquo;s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends out, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.</p>

                <h1><p>Mercury</p></h1>
                <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth&rsquo;s Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system &ndash; that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.</p>

                <h1><p>Venus</p></h1>
                <p>Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it&rsquo;s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It&rsquo;s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 475 degrees Celsius &ndash; hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it&rsquo;s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it&rsquo;s possible some volcanoes are still active.</p>

                <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that&rsquo;s inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.</p>

                <h1><p>The Moon</p></h1>
                <p>Our moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate, and creating a tidal rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth and the debris formed into the most prominent feature in our night sky. It is the only celestial a body beyond Earth that has been visited by human beings.</p>

                <h1><p>Jupiter</p></h1>
                <p>Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists &ndash; all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system &ndash; more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.</p>

                <p>Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings &ndash; made of chunks of ice and rock &ndash; but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn&#39;s. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>

                <h1><p>Uranus</p></h1>
                <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later when the object was universally accepted as a new planet.</p>

                <p>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.</p>
